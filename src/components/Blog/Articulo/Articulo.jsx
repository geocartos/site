        <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content thatâ€™s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
      
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>

        <h3>Example lists</h3>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First list item</li>
          <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
          <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>First list item</li>
          <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
          <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And this is a definition list:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
          <dd>The language used to describe and define the content of a Web page</dd>

          <dd>The programming language used to build advanced Web sites and applications</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Inline HTML elements</h2>
        <p>HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</p>

        <p>Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.</p>
        <h2>Heading</h2>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content.

        <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content.
